// Peer Review: This application is really impressive and complex. It clearly was planned out and everything works. I like the use of bools to check if player one and two are ready. also the code isnt bloated and has many interchangable parts depending on what buttons you pressed. the use of adding and removing classes to make it look like a button is toggled on is impressive. Switch cases are used correctly, and went above and beyond to add unique text to each scenario. Overall good job!
